# Game-Risk-in-C
The classic Risk game with an ASCII display in terminal.
This game allows you to play Risk, alone or with some friends, on your terminal, with a simple interface.
You can also create your own custom Risk. This is an easy but really long way to create
a all new board game. You just need to follow the same schema than the files "country.txt" and "continent.txt".
The scheme:
  for country.txt
  -> country_id country_name country_x country_y country_nb_conn list_country_id
  for continent.txt
  -> continent_name nb_country
  -> list_country_id
