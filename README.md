# Game-Risk-in-C
The classic Risk game with an ASCII display in terminal.
This game allows you to play Risk, alone or with some friends, on your terminal, with a simple interface.
You can also create your own custom Risk. This is an easy but really long way to create
a all new board game. You just need to follow the same schema than the files "country.txt" and "continent.txt".
